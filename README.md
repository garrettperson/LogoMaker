# Logo Maker

  ## Description
  My motivation in creating this project was to develop an application that creates custom SVG logos based on some user input. This project solves the problem of having to hire a graphic  designer to create a custom logo. In creating the project I learned a lot about object-oriented programming, test-driven development, and promises.
